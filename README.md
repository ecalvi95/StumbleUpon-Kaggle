For a school assignment, my team and I had to analyze a dataset from StumbleUpon and tell a story about what the data says via exploratory data analysis methods and machine learning models. 

ML Models Include:

Unsupervised:
- Bag-of-Words

Supervised: 
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes'
- Classification Tree
- Random Forest

The variables in the dataset are largely centered around technical aspects of the website. We learned that the story of the data mainly lies in the boilerplate variable, which includes the titles of webages shown to StumbleUpon users as well as a peek at the body of the webpages. The Kaggle competition's original purpose was to create a classifier to categorize websites as "evergreen" or "non-evergreen". We centered our story around what figuring out what made a webpage most likely to be classified as evergreen. We concluded that webpages that contained content about food were significantly more likely to be considered evergreen, while other topics like news, fashion, and sports were more likely to be labeled as non-evergreen or ephemeral. This make sense since there's a strong inflow of new information for news, fashion, and sports daily.
